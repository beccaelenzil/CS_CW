Week 1 (11/30-12/2)
I worked on and completed the camel game. I also began to learn about graphics.

Camel game looks good!

You don't need this code:
if done == True:
    playAgain()
Instead, you can simply run your playAgain() function once
done = True and you've excited the main game while loop

Week 2 (12/5-12/11)
Decided what game to make with some help from the kids in the music class. I will make
a fish game where you start as a small fish. You can always eat smaller fish than you
and must avoid bigger fish. Every time you eat a fish, you grow. When you touch a fish
that's larger than you, you die.
I also continued to learning graphics and animation. First, I began to make graphics
for the cover of my game. Then, I made an animation of a box bouncing off walls.

Please create new .py files for each lab and tutorial you complete so I can track your progresss.
Based on the work you've done, you should have
Ch5Tutorial.py
Ch11Tutorial.py
Ch8Tutorial.py
and Graphics.py


Week 3 (12/12 - 12/16)
This week, I worked on some graphics for my game and I learned controllers and graphics
in chapter 10.
I downloaded a free trial of photoshop, learned how to use it at a low level, and made a
background for my game. I also found good pictures for the fish in my game.
