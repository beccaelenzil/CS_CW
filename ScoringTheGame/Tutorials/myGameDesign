1. My game is about fish. The player will begin controlling a small SmallFish.
As a small fish, the player will have to dodge all of the big fish while trying
to find smaller fish to eat. If the player's fish is bigger than the fish it
touches, the player's fish will grow by the size of the fish it touched and the
smaller fish will disappear. If the player touches a fish that is bigger than
the one he is controlling, the game ends. All other fish in the game do not eat
one another. The objects in the game will be different types of fish: The fish
the player controls, SmallFishs swimming across the screen, piranhas swimming
across the screen, and sharks swimming across the screen. Music will be playing
in the background of the game and it will get more intense as the game goes on.
The main song will stop when the player dies and a short, sad song will play.
Every time a fish eats another fish, a crunching sound will play.
